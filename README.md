# Final Project
#### Introduction
What motivates your project?
- I've been wanting to learn more about Blender and proceduralism in Blender all year but haven't had a chance to. I've seen some tutorials from artists I follow about creating stylized buildings of this style and I want to utilize them in this project because I enjoy the stylized look and think putting a scene together would teach me about composition.

#### Goal
What do you intend to achieve with this project?
- I want to learn while also creating a project that showcases procedural placement and generation in order to create a stylized scene.

#### Inspiration/reference:
- You must have some form of reference material for your final project. Your reference may be a research paper, a blog post, some artwork, a video, another class at Penn, etc.  
- Include in your design doc links to and images of your reference material.

#### Specification:
Outline the main features of your project:
- Modeled village buildings, probably one hero building
- Procedural setup for randomized placement of buildings
- Props such as snow, lights, bridge possible
- Basic materials applied

#### Techniques:
What are the main technical/algorithmic tools you’ll be using? Give an overview, citing specific papers/articles.
- I will be using the open-source 3D software Blender for all aspects, I will not need plug ins as far as I know. I plan to use some modeling tutorials from Grant Abbitt and some procedural village/city videos, possibly one of these: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRYJeBUhSx4 or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYHocEhwPr0

#### Design:
- How will your program fit together? Make a simple free-body diagram illustrating the pieces.

#### Timeline:
Note: Timeline is adjusted from normal project guidelines because I switched projects
| Timeline | Goal |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Nov 22 - Nov 24 | Gather reference materials, including inspiration images and relevant Blender tutorials |
| Nov 24 - Nov 26 | Procedural layout is set up, models of varying houses are made |
| Nov 26 - Dec 1 | A complete procedural village scene that has been rendered with basic materials |

## Milestone 1: Implementation part 1 (due 11/12)
Begin implementing your engine! Don't worry too much about polish or parameter tuning -- this week is about getting together the bulk of your generator implemented. By the end of the week, even if your visuals are crude, the majority of your generator's functionality should be done.

Put all your code in your forked repository.

Submission: Add a new section to your README titled: Milestone #1, which should include
- written description of progress on your project goals. If you haven't hit all your goals, what's giving you trouble?
- Examples of your generators output so far
We'll check your repository for updates. No need to create a new pull request.
## Milestone 2: Implementation part 2 (due 11/24)
We're over halfway there! This week should be about fixing bugs and extending the core of your generator. Make sure by the end of this week _your generator works and is feature complete._ Any core engine features that don't make it in this week should be cut! Don't worry if you haven't managed to exactly hit your goals. We're more interested in seeing proof of your development effort than knowing your planned everything perfectly. 

Put all your code in your forked repository.

Submission: Add a new section to your README titled: Milestone #3, which should include
- written description of progress on your project goals. If you haven't hit all your goals, what did you have to cut and why? 
- Detailed output from your generator, images, video, etc.
We'll check your repository for updates. No need to create a new pull request.

Come to class on the due date with a WORKING COPY of your project. We'll be spending time in class critiquing and reviewing your work so far.

## Final submission (due 12/1)
Time to polish! Spen this last week of your project using your generator to produce beautiful output. Add textures, tune parameters, play with colors, play with camera animation. Take the feedback from class critques and use it to take your project to the next level.

Submission:
- Push all your code / files to your repository
- Come to class ready to present your finished project
- Update your README with two sections 
  - final results with images and a live demo if possible
  - post mortem: how did your project go overall? Did you accomplish your goals? Did you have to pivot?
